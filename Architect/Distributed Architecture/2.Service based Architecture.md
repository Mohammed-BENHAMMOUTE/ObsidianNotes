service based architecture can be defined as well-defined independent domains deployed as separate units of software.

they are not single purpose, it has all  the functionalities of a domain, and it can share a single a database.

it is recommended to use different schemas for different services, decoupling.

we can have an API gateway also in this architecture.


in the service based architecture we have between 3-12 services.


when to use: 
+ high time to market, high agility
+ cost 
+ migration target, moving service-based to go to microservices architecture.

when not to use:
+ High elasticity (Mean time to start is too long)
+ high semantic coupling between our domains.


benefits of service based architecture:
Scalability via independent deployment
