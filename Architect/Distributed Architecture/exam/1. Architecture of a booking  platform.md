	- **Business Impact**: System downtime = direct revenue loss and reputation damage
	- **Technical Requirements**: Multi-region deployment, failover mechanisms, 99.99% uptime
	- **Risk**: Complete business disruption during events
4. **Reliability** - HIGH PRIORITY
	- **Evidence**: Financial transactions, live streaming of unique events
	- **Business Impact**: Zero tolerance for payment errors or stream interruptions
	- **Technical Requirements**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, data consistency
	- **Risk**: Financial losses, legal disputes, customer churn
5. **Interoperability** - MEDIUM PRIORITY

- **Evidence**: "third-party payment systems", "merging with global players"
- **Business Impact**: Seamless integration with external systems and acquired companies
- **Technical Requirements**: Standard APIs, protocol adapters, middleware
- **Risk**: Integration failures, vendor lock-in

6. **Observability** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
	- **Evidence**: "supervision", "monitoring", complex distributed system
	- **Business Impact**: Proactive issue detection, performance optimization
	- **Technical Requirements**: Centralized logging, real-time metrics, distributed tracing
	- **Risk**: Blind spots leading to undetected failures
7. **Deployability** - MEDIUM PRIORITY

	- **Evidence**: "very fast market launch required", competitive market
	- **Business Impact**: Rapid feature delivery, competitive time-to-market
	- **Technical Requirements**: CI/CD pipelines, blue-green deployment, feature flags
	- **Risk**: Slow delivery losing market opportunities
