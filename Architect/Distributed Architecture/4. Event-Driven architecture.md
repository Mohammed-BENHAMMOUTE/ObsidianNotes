asynchronously responds to events that are triggered in a system.

based on a streaming broker or event broker.
this is not a message bus, all it does is deliver the message.


when to use event driven architecture:
+ abstraction
+ performance
+ fault-tolerance
+ elasticity

when not to use:
+ simplicity 
+ testability
+ high data integrity
+ high priority for event order.



# Use cases of event driven architecture

publish/subscribe architecture 
the good thing is the publisher doesn't know about the subscribers.

its difference between it and observer pattern is that in the observer pattern, publisher do `know` about the subscribers.



the benefits of this architecture is decoupling?
so we can scale services as we want.

its fast.


+ use cases:
  real time notifications, 



## design patterns in event driven architecture


### 1. Event Notification pattern 

the event is published into a message broker, and the subscribed services can pick it up. once we get the ACK, the event can be flushed. 

other wise we keep the event in the queue for some period of time, if no subscriber consumes it then it is sent to a dead letter queue.
