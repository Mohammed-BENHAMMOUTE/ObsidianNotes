## Specific Implementation for OWASP Top 10 Protection

Mitigation to Owasp top 10 vulnerabilities:

1. **Broken Access Control**
    
    - [x] Implement proper authentication and authorization with Keycloak
    - [x] Use Spring Security's method-level security
    - [x] Validate user permissions at the API gateway
2. **Cryptographic Failures**
    
    - [ ] Use TLS 1.3 for all connections
    - [x] Implement proper key management with Vault
    - [ ] Use strong encryption algorithms for data at rest
3. **Injection**
    
    - [x] Use parameterized queries with JPA/Hibernate
    - [ ] Implement input validation at API boundaries
    - [ ] Use safe object serialization/deserialization
4. **Insecure Design**
    
    - [ ] Conduct threat modeling during design phase
    - [ ] Implement security review in sprint planning
    - [ ] Use security design patterns
5. **Security Misconfiguration**
    - [ ] Implement configuration validation
    - [ ] Use immutable infrastructure patterns
6. **Vulnerable Components**
    
    - [ ] Regular dependency scanning with SCA tools
    - [ ] Maintain an inventory of all dependencies
7. **Authentication Failures**
    
    - [ ] Implement MFA with Keycloak
    - [ ] Use secure password policies
    - [ ] Implement account lockout mechanisms
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**
    
    - [ ] Sign containers and artifacts

    - [ ] Implement secure CI/CD pipelines
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
    
    - [ ] Centralized logging with security events
    - [ ] Implement proper audit logging
    - [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activities
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery**
    
    - [ ] Validate and sanitize all URLs
    - [ ] Implement allow-lists for external services
    - [ ] Use API Gateway to control outbound requests
