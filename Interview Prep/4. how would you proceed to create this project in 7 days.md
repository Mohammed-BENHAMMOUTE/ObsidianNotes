> If I had 7 days to build a project that optimizes invoice processing, I would focus on building a simple but working solution that shows how we can save time or reduce manual effort. On **Day 1**, I would start by understanding the exact problem: are we reading invoices from PDFs? Do we need to extract data like dates, amounts, and supplier names? I’d also ask what the current manual process looks like and what needs improvement.

> On **Days 2 to 5**, I would build the main part of the project. I’d use a language like **Python** and tools like **Tesseract OCR** or **PyMuPDF** to extract text from invoice files (PDFs or images). Then I’d write code to pick out key fields (like invoice number or total amount) and clean the data. After that, I’d add simple rules to check if the invoice looks correct — for example, flagging missing fields or incorrect totals.

> On **Day 6**, I would test it with a few real or sample invoices to see how well it works. I’d fix bugs, improve accuracy, and make sure the system works end-to-end.

> On **Day 7**, I’d add a simple interface — maybe a webpage where a user can upload invoices and see the results — and write basic documentation to explain how it works.

> The final result would be a small demo project that reads invoices, extracts important info, checks for basic errors, and saves the cleaned data — showing that we can reduce manual work and make invoice processing faster.
