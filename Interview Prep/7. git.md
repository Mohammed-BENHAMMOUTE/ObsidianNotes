git fetch downloads the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository, but it does not merge them into your current working branch. It updates your remote tracking branches (e.g., origin/main), so you can review the changes before merging.

git pull is essentially a combination of git fetch followed by git merge. It downloads and automatically merges the changes from the remote branch into your current branch.
