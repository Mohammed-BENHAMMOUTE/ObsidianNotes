REST (Representational State Transfer): 
REST stands for _Representational State Transfer_ â€” it's an architectural style that defines a set of principles for designing networked applications. It emphasizes stateless communication, a uniform interface, and resource-based URLs.

A **RESTful API** is an **implementation** of those REST principles over HTTP. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources.

So, REST is the **theory or design philosophy**, while a RESTful API is the **practical application** of that theory.
