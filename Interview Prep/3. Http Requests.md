## PUT vs PATCH
**PUT** and **PATCH** are both HTTP methods used to update resources, but they behave differently. **PUT** is used for a **complete replacement** of a resource. When you send a PUT request, the entire resource is overwritten with the new data ‚Äî any missing fields are removed. On the other hand, **PATCH** is used for **partial updates**. It modifies only the fields you specify in the request, leaving the rest of the resource unchanged. In general, use PUT when you're replacing the full resource, and PATCH when you're just updating one or a few fields.
