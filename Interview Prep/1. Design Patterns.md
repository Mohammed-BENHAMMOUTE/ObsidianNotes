## Creational Design Patterns
concerned with object creation, They abstract the instrantiation process and make the system independant of how objects are created, composed and represented.


**Example**:
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

Itâ€™s used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
## Structural Design Patterns 
These deal with object composition and typically help make sure that if one part of code changes, the entire structure doesn't need to change too.

Examples: 

**Adapter**: allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.

**Proxy**: the observable has a list of observers that it notifies when a certain event happens.

**Decorator**: 	Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically (without modifying them).




## 3. Behavioral Patterns 
These focus on **communication between objects**, what goes on between objects and how they interact.

examples:
+ Observer
+ Strategy 
+ State 
+ Iterator

| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Creational** | Object creation logic               | Singleton, Factory, Builder        |
| **Structural** | Object composition / structure      | Adapter, Composite, Decorator      |
| **Behavioral** | Object interaction & responsibility | Observer, Strategy, Command, State |
