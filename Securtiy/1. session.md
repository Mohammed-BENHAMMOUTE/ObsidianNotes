2. **Attack Prevention and Countermeasures**
3. **Authentication and Access Control**

---

## Section 1: Secure Development Principles

### 1. Security in SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

#### What is SDLC?

- **Definition**: A framework defining tasks executed at each stage of software development
- **Standard**: ISO/IEC 12207 - international standard for software lifecycle processes
- **Purpose**: Provides detailed plan for developing, maintaining, replacing, and improving software
- **Goal**: Improve software quality and overall development process

#### Traditional SDLC Phases:

1. **Requirements Analysis** (Analyses des exigences)
2. **Architecture & Design** (Archit et Design)
3. **Code Implementation** (Réalisation du code)
4. **Testing & Acceptance** (Tests et Acceptation)
5. **Production Deployment** (Mise en production)
6. **Maintenance** (Maintenance)

#### Critical Problem:

**Security issue costs increase exponentially when discovered late in development cycle**

### 2. Secure-SDLC

#### Solution:

Address security concerns throughout the entire development cycle, not just at the end.

#### Benefits of Secure-SDLC:

- Security becomes permanent concern for robust software development
- Stakeholder security awareness
- Early anomaly detection in system
- Reduced costs from system anomalies and problem resolution
- Overall business risk reduction

#### Major Secure-SDLC Approaches:

1. **MS SDL (Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle)**: One of the first, proposed by Microsoft
2. **NIST 800-64**: Provides security considerations in SDLC
3. **OWASP CLASP**: Simple to implement, based on MS SDL, maps security activities to organizational roles

#### Security Activities by Phase:

**Requirements Analysis:**

- Establish security requirements
- Risk analysis

**Architecture & Design:**

- Risk analysis
- Attack surface reduction
- Threat modeling

**Code Implementation:**

- Static analysis
- Code review

**Testing & Acceptance:**

- Penetration testing
- Attack surface examination
- Final review

**Production:**

- Documentation
- Audit

**Maintenance:**

- Ongoing security monitoring

## 2. Threat Modeling (Modélisation des menaces)

### Purpose:

- Help team identify software vulnerabilities
- Identify and evaluate application-related threats
- Reduce overall risks while maintaining security
- Identify resources
- Establish foundation for security design specifications

### Advantages:

- Better application understanding
- Error detection capability
- Identification of complex design errors
- Integration of new team members
- Establishment of well-designed security testing programs

### 6-Step Threat Modeling Process:

#### Step 1: Identify Resources

Identify what needs protection:

- Confidential data (customer databases)
- Web pages
- System availability
- Any elements that, if damaged, could prevent proper application functioning

#### Step 2: Create Architecture Overview

- Identify what the application does
- Create architecture diagram
- Identify technologies used

#### Step 3: Decompose the Application

- Break down the application into components
- Create security profile based on classic vulnerability domains
- Examine interactions between different subsystems
- Use UML or data flow diagrams

**Key Activities:**

- Identify security boundaries
- Identify data flow
- Identify entry points
- Identify privileged code
- Document security profile

#### Step 4: Identify Threats

**Categories:**

- Network-related threats
- Host-related threats
- Application-related threats

**Using STRIDE Model:**

|Threat Type|Examples|
|---|---|
|**Spoofing** (Usurpation)|Email falsification, Authentication packet replay|
|**Tampering** (Falsification)|Data modification during transmission, File data changes|
|**Repudiation** (Répudiation)|Deleting important file and denying action, Purchasing product and denying action|
|**Information Disclosure** (Divulgation)|Information exposure in error messages, Code exposure on websites|
|**Denial of Service** (Déni de service)|Network flooding with SYN packets, Network flooding with falsified ICMP packets|
|**Elevation of Privilege** (Élévation de privilèges)|Buffer overflow exploitation for system privileges, Illegal administrator privilege acquisition|

#### Step 5: Document Threats

Create threat documentation including:

- **Threat Description**: e.g., "SQL Command Injection"
- **Threat Target**: e.g., "Data Access Component"
- **Risk Level**
- **Attack Techniques**: e.g., "Intruder adds SQL commands to username used to form SQL query"
- **Countermeasures**: e.g., "Use regular expression to validate username and stored procedure with parameters for database access"

**Risk Assessment Formula:**

```
Risk = Probability × Potential Damage
```

**DREAD Model for Threat Scoring:**

- **D**amage potential (Dommage potentiel)
- **R**eproducibility (Reproductibilité)
- **E**xploitability (Exploitation)
- **A**ffected users (Utilisateurs Affectés)
- **D**iscoverability (Découverte)

#### Step 6: Evaluate Threats

Prioritize threats based on risk assessment and implement appropriate countermeasures.

## 3. Case Study: Electronic Bill Payment System

The course includes a practical case study of an electronic bill payment system that demonstrates:

- Initial network model
- Trust zones identification
- Flow matrix (ports & protocols)
- Major risks and threats list
- Corrected network model after security analysis

**Key Learning Points from Case Study:**

- How to apply threat modeling to real systems
- Identification of trust boundaries
- Network security architecture
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Key Exam Points to Remember:

### Critical Concepts:

1. **SDLC vs Secure-SDLC**: Traditional development vs security-integrated development
2. **Cost Principle**: Security fixes become exponentially more expensive later in development
3. **6-Step Threat Modeling Process**: Must know all steps and their purposes
4. **STRIDE Model**: Know all 6 threat types with examples
5. **DREAD Model**: Risk assessment methodology
6. **Security Activities**: What security measures apply to each SDLC phase

### Formulas to Remember:

- **Risk = Probability × Potential Damage**
- **STRIDE**: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
- **DREAD**: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability

### Practical Applications:

- Be able to identify threats in a given system
- Know how to create threat documentation
- Understand security boundaries and data flows
- Know appropriate countermeasures for common threats (especially SQL injection example)

This summary covers all the essential material from Chapter 1. The remaining sections (Attack Prevention/Countermeasures and Authentication/Access Control) would build upon these foundational concepts.
