generaly two types of dynamic programming :
1. combinatorics: count the number of ways.
2. greedy: minimise maximise.



	**one can think of dynamic programming as a table-filling algorithm: you know the calculations you have to do, so you pick th ebest order to do them in and ignore the ones don'r have to fill in.**

sample problem: 
	you are given a number N, you've to find the number of different ways to write it as sum of 1, 3 and 4.
