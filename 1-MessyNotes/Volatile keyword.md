The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads. Declaring a variable as `volatile` ensures that:  
  

1. **Visibility**: Changes to the variable are immediately visible to all threads. When a thread modifies a `volatile` variable, the new value is written directly to the main memory, and when another thread reads the `volatile` variable, it reads the value from the main memory.  
      
    
2. **Atomicity**: Operations on `volatile` variables are atomic, meaning that the read and write operations are indivisible. However, this does not apply to compound actions like incrementing a variable (i.e., `x++`).  

In the context of the singleton pattern, using `volatile` ensures that the `instance` variable is correctly handled in a multi-threaded environment, preventing issues like seeing a partially constructed object.
