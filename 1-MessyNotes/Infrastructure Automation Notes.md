## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Fundamentals

### Traditional vs Automated Infrastructure Management

In traditional infrastructure management, IT engineers face several challenges:
- Manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone
- Lack of scalability and repeatability
- High human resource requirements
- Inconsistent environments
- No version control or rollback capabilities

IaC addresses these challenges by treating infrastructure configuration as software code, enabling automation of:
1. Infrastructure provisioning
2. Configuration management
3. Application deployment

### Key IaC Implementation Approaches

The implementation of IaC can follow two main philosophical approaches:

**Declarative vs Procedural**
- Declarative: Specifies the desired end state (what you want)
- Procedural: Details step-by-step instructions (how to get there)

**Mutable vs Immutable**
- Mutable: Infrastructure components can be modified in place
- Immutable: Components are replaced rather than modified

**Agent vs Agentless**
- Agent-based: Requires software installation on managed systems
- Agentless: Operates without additional software installation

## Terraform: Infrastructure Provisioning

### Core Architecture

Terraform operates through three main components:

1. **Core Engine**
   - Compares current state with desired state
   - Generates execution plans
   - Manages state tracking

2. **State Management**
   - Tracks current infrastructure state
   - Enables planning and change detection
   - Maintains resource relationships

3. **Providers**
   - Interface with various platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Over 3000 providers available
   - Enable resource management across services

### Essential Terraform Commands

The basic workflow involves:

```hcl
terraform init    # Initialize working directory
terraform plan   # Preview changes
terraform apply  # Execute changes
terraform destroy # Remove infrastructure
```

## Ansible: Configuration Management

### Key Characteristics

Ansible distinguishes itself through:
- Agentless architecture (uses SSH)
- YAML-based configuration
- Combination of procedural and declarative approaches
- Support for all major infrastructure types

### Core Components

1. **Modules**
   - Self-contained units of functionality
   - Each module handles specific tasks
   - Can be combined for complex operations

2. **Playbooks**
   - Define automation tasks
   - Specify host targets
   - Configure execution order
   - Manage variables and conditions

3. **Inventory**
   - Lists managed hosts
   - Defines host groups
   - Specifies connection parameters

## GitOps

### Fundamental Concepts

GitOps represents a modern approach to continuous deployment with:
- Git repository as single source of truth
- Declarative system descriptions
- Automated reconciliation processes

### Benefits

1. **Operational Advantages**
   - Faster deployment cycles
   - Simplified error recovery
   - Better credential management
   - Self-documenting systems

2. **Team Collaboration**
   - Shared knowledge base
   - Version control for infrastructure
   - Clear audit trail

### Implementation Patterns

Two primary approaches:
1. **Push-based Deployments**
   - CI/CD pipeline triggers deployments
   - Direct interaction with infrastructure

2. **Pull-based Deployments**
   - Operators monitor Git repository
   - Automatic synchronization with desired state

## Deployment Strategies

### Common Approaches

1. **All at Once**
   - Complete replacement in single action
   - Requires downtime
   - Simple but risky

2. **Rolling Deployment**
   - Gradual update process
   - Supports canary releases
   - Minimizes impact of issues

3. **Blue/Green Deployment**
   - Creates parallel environments
   - Enables instant rollback
   - Reduces deployment risk

1. The differences between infrastructure provisioning and configuration management
2. Key commands and concepts in Terraform
3. Ansible's architecture and component relationships.
4. GitOps principles and benefits.
5. Different deployment strategies and their trade-offs.
