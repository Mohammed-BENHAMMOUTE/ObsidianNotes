Ways to do Dependency Injection in Spring Boot:

1. Constructor Injection
2. Setter Injection
3. Field Injection
4. Interface Injection (less common in Spring)

Let's look at each method:

1. Constructor Injection:
```java
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}
```

2. Setter Injection:
```java
public class UserService {
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    public void setUserRepository(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}
```

3. Field Injection:
```java
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;
}
```

4. Interface Injection (not directly supported by Spring, but can be implemented):
```java
public interface UserRepositoryInjector {
    void injectUserRepository(UserRepository userRepository);
}

public class UserService implements UserRepositoryInjector {
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Override
    public void injectUserRepository(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}
```

Most Practical and Recommended Approaches:

In real projects, the most recommended approach is Constructor Injection. Here's why:

1. Constructor Injection:
   - Promotes immutability: Dependencies can be declared as final.
   - Ensures dependencies are available at object creation time.
   - Makes it clear what dependencies a class needs.
   - Easier to test: You can easily provide mock dependencies in unit tests.
   - Prevents circular dependencies.

Example of best practice:
```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
    private final EmailService emailService;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository, EmailService emailService) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }

    // Methods using userRepository and emailService
}
```

Note: As of Spring 4.3, if a class has only one constructor, you can omit the @Autowired annotation.

Field injection, while convenient, is generally discouraged for several reasons:
- It makes the code harder to test.
- It hides dependencies, making the code less readable.
- It doesn't allow for final fields, potentially leading to issues with concurrent access.

Setter injection can be useful in certain scenarios, particularly when dealing with optional dependencies or when you need to change dependencies at runtime. However, it's generally less common than constructor injection in modern Spring applications.

In Practice:
1. Use Constructor Injection for required dependencies.
2. Consider Setter Injection for optional dependencies.
3. Avoid Field Injection in production code.
4. Always aim for code that is easy to test and maintain.

Additional Best Practices:
- Program to interfaces rather than concrete classes.
- Use @Autowired sparingly; in many cases, it's not needed with constructor injection.
- Consider using final fields for injected dependencies to ensure immutability.
- For configurations, use @Configuration classes with @Bean methods instead of XML.

Example combining these practices:
```java
@Service
public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
    private final EmailService emailService;

    public UserServiceImpl(UserRepository userRepository, EmailService emailService) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }

    @Override
    public void registerUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
        emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user.getEmail());
    }
}
```

This approach provides a clean, testable, and maintainable way to handle dependencies in your Spring Boot applications.
