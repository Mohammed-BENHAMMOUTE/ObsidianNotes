[[DevOps]]
## def:
observe and check the quality of something over a period of time, keep under systematic review.


why do we monitor?
1. Problem detection (performance, security, etc ).
2. Troubleshooting.
3. reporting and improvement.

what to monitor?
+ demand (user action, API call, request payload, etc.)
+ Workload (availability , performance, faults/error , etc.)
+ Resources (technical metrics, CPU, Memory, I/O, etc..)


**targets** : composant de notre systeme qu'on veut supervise.
rules: rules we establish to in our system if they are violated we send an alerts.
alerts : alerts ;)
logs: naturalization de l'execution dans notre application.
visualization: Grafana.

2. modeling system: 
   dwr: the most mature one (more than use and red).
   call stack response payload software structure: tracing?
   usage spike: Higher demand drives more workloads, consuming all the ressources 

## Observability 
combining the different types of metrics to extracts <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">business</mark>  metrics.
in a way that can demonstrate how healthy you system is?

```
Observability = METRICS + LOGS + TRACES
```
not really a good equation but why?


## Why Obervability?

yield meaningful and actionable data allowing to achieve favorable data, allowing to achieve <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">meaningful</mark> actions.


## Types of Monitoring systems:
+ synthetic monitoring
+ end user monitoring:
  + Instruction options:
    1. web access logs.
    2. network analysis.
    3. mobile instrumentation.
    4. browser injection.
    5. Desktop instrumentation: User device(desktop apps).
+ system monitoring 
+ network monitoring: 
  1. SNMP (simple network management protocol): porotocol d'admisitration ...
  2. Packet analysis.
  3. Netflow.
+ application monitoring:
  + problem examples:
    1. System bottleneck: a service that degrades our system.
    2. Tracing: traceability of calls on all services at all time. application distribuee.
