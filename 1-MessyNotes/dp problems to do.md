  
1. Matrix Chain Multiplication (UVa 348)

- Similar concept of finding optimal way to multiply matrices to minimize operations

  

2. Optimal Binary Search Tree (GFG)

- Finding the optimal arrangement of nodes to minimize search cost

  

3. Boolean Parenthesization (LeetCode 1246)

- Find ways to parenthesize boolean expressions to achieve desired result

  

4. Burst Balloons (LeetCode 312)

- Similar to cutting sticks, but you burst balloons to maximize points

  

5. Remove Boxes (LeetCode 546)

- Remove boxes of same color to maximize points, similar interval-based DP

  

6. Stone Game (UVa 10404)

- Strategic game where players take stones, need to find optimal play

  

7. Palindrome Partitioning (LeetCode 132)

- Cut string into palindromes with minimum cuts

  

8. Score of Parentheses (LeetCode 856)

- Evaluate score of parentheses string with specific rules

  

9. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones (LeetCode 1000)

- Merge piles of stones with minimum cost, similar to cutting sticks
