what are basis of web security ? 
+ confidentiality = chiffrement + steganography = cacher l'information.
+ integrity,
+ availability => replication(System mechanism), 
+ Authentification/ Authenticite = chiffrement
  Authenticite = utiliser un jeton uniquement utiliser par son proprietaire. (Authentification avec a unique) 
+ 

Security measures are based on cryptography.

cryptography = codage(not security) + chiffrement + Steganography + hachage + signature + certificat...

what is the **difference** between **symmetric** and **Asymmetric** encryption:

symmetric: single key + rappppide - vulnerabilty
what is the length if the key.
 
asymmetric :  public and private key

for confidentialty: 
the one that creates the keys is the receiver, and we use the public for encryption.

for authenticity:
we use the private key for authentication, because we want to impose our print , and we decrypt using the

non-repudiation= au minimum autentification + integrite + Imputabilite.

signature = cryptage du hash (authenicite + integrite)
