# Collaborative Web IDE: Project Architecture and System Design

## 1. High-Level Architecture

```
[Client Browsers] <--> [Load Balancer] <--> [Web Servers] <--> [Application Servers] <--> [Database]
                                                               ^
                                                               |
                                                         [WebSocket Servers]
```

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1 Frontend
- Single Page Application (SPA) using a modern framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular)
- Code editor component (e.g., Monaco Editor, used in VS Code)
- Real-time collaboration features
- User authentication and project management UI

### 2.2 Backend
- RESTful API for user management, project management, and non-real-time operations
- WebSocket server for real-time collaboration
- Authentication and authorization service
- Code execution service (if you plan to allow code running)

### 2.3 Database
- User data
- Project data
- Code snapshots and version history

### 2.4 File Storage
- For larger projects or binary files

## 3. Real-time Collaboration

- Implement Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for managing concurrent edits
- Use WebSockets for real-time communication
- Implement a pub/sub system for managing multiple users in the same document

## 4. Detailed Component Breakdown

### 4.1 Frontend (SPA)
- Framework: React with TypeScript
- State Management: Redux or MobX
- Code Editor: Monaco Editor
- WebSocket Client: Socket.io client
- Styling: CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components

### 4.2 Backend
- Language: Node.js with TypeScript
- Web Framework: Express.js
- WebSocket Server: Socket.io
- ORM: TypeORM or Prisma
- Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens
- API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI

### 4.3 Database
- Primary Database: PostgreSQL
- Caching Layer: Redis

### 4.4 DevOps
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: Jenkins or GitLab CI
- Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## 5. Key Features and Considerations

### 5.1 User Management
- Registration, login, password reset
- User roles and permissions
- OAuth integration for easy sign-up

### 5.2 Project Management
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for projects
- Sharing and collaboration settings
- Version control integration (e.g., Git)

### 5.3 Real-time Collaboration
- Cursor and selection synchronization
- Real-time code updates
- Conflict resolution
- Presence indicators (who's currently editing)

### 5.4 Code Intelligence
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-completion
- Error checking and linting
- Code formatting

### 5.5 Additional Features
- Chat or comments system for communication
- File explorer and management
- Search functionality
- Themes and customization options

### 5.6 Security Considerations
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### 5.7 Scalability Considerations
- Horizontal scaling of web and WebSocket servers
- Database sharding for large-scale deployments
- Caching strategies to reduce database load
- CDN integration for static assets

## 6. Development Roadmap

1. MVP with basic collaborative editing
2. User authentication and project management
3. Enhanced code intelligence features
4. Version control integration
5. Additional collaboration features (chat, comments)
6. Performance optimizations and scaling
7. Mobile responsiveness and PWA support
