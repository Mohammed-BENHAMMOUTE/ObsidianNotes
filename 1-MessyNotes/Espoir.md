## Key Arguments in Strategic Order

1. **Rich History and Strong Foundation**
   - Emphasize CIT's 28-year legacy (established in 1996) as a pillar of INPT's extracurricular activities
   - Highlight how the club helps students develop responsibility, event management skills, and professional connections

2. **Comprehensive Technical Training Program**
   - Showcase your six specialized training tracks (Security, Data/AI, DevOps, Algorithms, Web Development, Design)
   - Mention that over 300 INPT students benefited from these free training programs this year

3. **Prestigious National Events**
   - IDEH (International Days of Ethical Hacking) - A cybersecurity conference and competition that attracts experts and participants from across Morocco
   - JNJD (National Day of Young Developers) - One of Morocco's most prestigious programming competitions, bringing together 50 schools and 150 participants

4. **Strategic Industry Partnerships**
   - DataCamp partnership providing 150 students with accounts valued at $400 each
   - WePwn collaboration offering advanced cybersecurity training
   - Highlight collaborative relationships with companies like La Marocaine Vie

5. **Inter-School Leadership and Collaboration**
   - Founding member of Union des Codeurs, connecting six engineering schools
   - Benefiting over 400 students across these institutions through algorithm training

6. **Continuous Knowledge Sharing**
   - Regular conferences with renowned speakers (Sghiouar Abdelfettah, Ahmed Kachkach, Rachid Guerraoui)
   - Expert-led workshops on cutting-edge technologies
   - CIT Talks podcast featuring successful alumni and tech leaders
   - Tips & Tricks series on social media sharing practical expertise

7. **Innovative Student Engagement**
   - Integration activities for new students (Bizu Code Zone, Bizu Catch The Flag)
   - Ramadan League competition combining data science, algorithms, and cybersecurity challenges
   - Collaborative events with other institutions (like Akasec from 1337)

For the most impact, I suggest highlighting how CIT creates a complete ecosystem for students - from welcoming newcomers to providing advanced technical training, offering platforms to test skills in competitions, connecting with industry, and building a supportive community that extends beyond INPT.

Be sure to emphasize concrete results and numbers whenever possible (300+ students trained, 150 DataCamp accounts, 50 schools participating in JNJD, etc.) as these tangible outcomes will strongly support your case.
