[[java]]

java is a write once run everywhere, this is through java virtual machine which is platform specific, processing the instructions in the bytecode in a way thats coherent with the platform (hardware ) you are using.

## The pillars of OOP:
1. **Abstraction**: The software objects represent a subset of behaviors and information of the real world objects.
2. **Encapsulation**: The software object  hides its Implementation details and internal state.
3. **Inheritance**: A specialized  type (child) inherits code from more general type (parent).
4. **Polymorphism**: Objects of different types respond differently to the same message.
   
a class represent a concept or a thing , a concept of something , a type.
