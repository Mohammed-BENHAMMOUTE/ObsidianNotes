## Definition
State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears if the object has changed its class.

the idea behind this pattern is that at any given time, the there's a finite number of states which  an object  can be in. Within any unique, the program behaves differently, and the program can switch states which a program can be.at any given state the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to the other,
