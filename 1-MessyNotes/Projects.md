[[Project Ideas]]
As a software engineering student, creating projects that solve real-world problems is an excellent way to make your CV stand out. Here are six project ideas tailored to showcase your various skills:

Frontend Projects:

1. Study Buddy: A web application that helps students organize their study schedules, track assignments, and collaborate with peers. It could include features like a Pomodoro timer, task management, and integration with popular learning management systems.

2. Code Snippet Manager: A web-based tool for developers to store, organize, and share code snippets. Include features like syntax highlighting, tagging, and search functionality.

Backend Projects:

3. API for Academic Resource Sharing: Develop a RESTful API that allows universities to share academic resources like research papers, datasets, and course materials. Implement authentication, rate limiting, and data versioning.

4. Automated Code Review System: Create a backend service that analyzes submitted code for common issues, coding standards violations, and potential bugs. It could integrate with version control systems and provide detailed reports.

Mobile Development Project:

5. Campus Navigator: A mobile app that helps students navigate their university campus, find classrooms, locate available study spaces, and check facility hours. Include features like indoor mapping, real-time occupancy data, and event notifications.

DevOps Project:

6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline for Student Projects: Design and implement a CI/CD pipeline specifically for student projects. It should automatically build, test, and deploy applications to a cloud platform, and provide detailed feedback on code quality and performance.

These projects address real-world problems related to your life as a software engineering student while demonstrating a wide range of skills. They're also scalable, allowing you to start with basic functionality and add more advanced features as you progress.
