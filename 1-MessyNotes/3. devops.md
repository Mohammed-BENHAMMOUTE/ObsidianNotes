### Observability and Monitoring: An Overview

---

#### **Introduction**

- **Objective**: Monitoring and observability of systems, from development to production.
- **Key Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana).

#### **Part 1: Monitoring Basics**

1. **What is Monitoring?**
    
    - Definition: Systematic observation of metrics over time.
    - **Why Monitor?**
        - Detect issues (performance, security, etc.).
        - Troubleshoot problems.
        - Enable reporting and improvement.
    - **What to Monitor?**
        - **Demand**: User actions, API calls.
        - **Workload**: Availability, performance, errors.
        - **Resources**: CPU, memory, I/O.
2. **Modeling Systems**
    
    - **Frameworks**:
        - **USE Model**: Utilization, Saturation, Errors.
        - **RED Model**: Request rate, Errors, Duration.
        - **DWR Model**: Demand, Workload, Resources.
    - **Scenarios**:
        - Optimal state: Balanced demand, workload, resources.
        - Usage spikes: High demand consuming resources.
        - Software limitations: Overprovisioned resources constrained by code.
3. **Observability**
    
    - **Definition**: Inferring internal system states from external outputs.
    - **Benefits**:
        - Actionable data for faster incident response.
        - Increased developer productivity.
        - Reduced downtime.

#### **Part 2: Types of Monitoring**

1. **Synthetic Monitoring**
    
    - Automated tests simulating user transactions.
    - Tools: Open source and vendor solutions.
2. **End-User Monitoring**
    
    - Tracks user behavior and experience.
    - Data Sources:
        - Web access logs.
        - Mobile instrumentation.
        - Browser injection.
3. **System Monitoring**
    
    - Key metrics: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
4. **Network Monitoring**
    
    - Protocols like SNMP and NetFlow.
    - Methods:
        - Topology mapping.
        - Packet analysis.
5. **Application Monitoring**
    
    - Tracks throughput, response time, and errors.
    - Tools: Metrics libraries, application tracing.
6. **Log Monitoring**
    
    - Scans log files for patterns to detect events.
    - Examples: Errors, warnings, debug information.

#### **Part 3: Prometheus Monitoring on Kubernetes**

1. **Installation**
    
    - Using Helm:
        - Add Prometheus repository.
        - Install with `$ helm install`.
    - Components created:
        - Pods, services, deployments, secrets, CRDs.
    - Access Prometheus UI via port forwarding (default port: 9090).
2. **Grafana Integration**
    
    - Steps to access Grafana:
        - Identify Grafana pod.
        - Use port forwarding (default port: 3000).
    - Visualizations:
        - Kubernetes metrics for nodes, components, and pods.
3. **MongoDB Monitoring**
    
    - Steps:
        - Deploy MongoDB as a service in Kubernetes.
        - Add it as a Prometheus target using Helm.
        - Visualize metrics in Grafana.

#### **Part 4: Logging with EFK in Kubernetes**

1. **Components**:
    
    - **Elasticsearch**: Stores logs.
    - **Fluentd**: Collects and sends logs.
    - **Kibana**: Visualizes logs.
2. **Setup**:
    
    - Install components using Helm.
    - Verify installations with pod and service checks.
3. **Viewing Logs**:
    
    - Deploy a sample application.
    - Use Kibana to filter logs (e.g., `kubernetes.pod_name: counter`).

---

#### **Conclusion**

- **Monitoring** ensures system health by tracking predefined metrics.
- **Observability** provides deeper insights into system performance and issues.
- Combining tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and EFK delivers robust monitoring and logging capabilities.
