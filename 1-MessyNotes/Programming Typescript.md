+ why do we need type Safety?
`We use type safety to prevent programs from doing invalid things`
**Typescript Compiler:**
	the code that first is written is first converted into ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE  `AST`. a data structure that ignores things like white spaces and comments ....
	that AST is then compiled into bytecode. and then ByteCode is evaluated by the run time.
	**Once again here are the s**teps for compiling Javascript:
		`- Program is parsed into an AST.`
    
		- AST is compiled to bytecode.
    
		- Bytecode is evaluated by the runtime.
However Typescript  uses a different approach by compiling to Javascript, and before that it makes your code safer by using the typechecker:
~Typechceker: is a program that makes sure that your code is type safe.
here are the steps for compiling TS code:
1. **TypeScript Source -> TypeScript AST**
2. **AST is checked using a typechecker**
3. **Typescript AST** -> **Javascript source**
4. **Javascript Source code -> Javascript AST**
5. **AST -> bytecode**
6. **Bytecode is Evaluated by runtime**
javascript compilers and runtimes are smushed into a single program called an engine.
example of Engines:
1. V8(nodejs, chrome, Opera)
2. SpiderMonkey (fireFox)
3. JScore (Safari)
4. Chakra (Edge)

| Type system feature                    | JavaScript          | TypeScript               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **How are types bound?**               | Dynamically         | Statically               |
| **Are types automatically converted?** | Yes                 | No (mostly)              |
| **When are types checked?**            | At runtime          | At compile time          |
| **When are errors surfaced?**          | At runtime (mostly) | At compile time (mostly) |
Dynamic Typing in JavaScript means that it doesn't know the types until it runs the code. meaning at runtime.
Static Typing means that Typescripts knows the types in Compile time.
TypeScript is Gradually Staticly typed: That means that TypeScript works best when it knows the types of everything in your program at compile time, but it doesnâ€™t have to know every type in order to compile your program.
