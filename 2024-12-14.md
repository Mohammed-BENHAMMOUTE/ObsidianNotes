### **1. Overall Architecture**

The system will follow a **layered architecture** with these main layers:

#### **1.1. Presentation Layer**

- Provides the user interface (CLI or GUI) to interact with the system.
- Delegates user requests to the service layer.

#### **1.2. Service Layer**

- Implements the business logic, managing books and rentals.
- Coordinates between the domain and persistence layers.

#### **1.3. Domain Layer**

- Defines core entities like `Book`, `Member`, and `Rental`.
- Contains the abstractions and business rules.

#### **1.4. Persistence Layer**

- Handles data storage and retrieval.
- Can use in-memory storage for simplicity or extend to a database.

### **2. Class List**

#### **2.1. Presentation Layer**

- **MainApp**: Entry point of the application, where users interact.
    - Handles user input (e.g., add book, rent book).
    - Delegates to `LibraryManager` or `RentalService`.

#### **2.2. Service Layer**

- **LibraryManager**:
    - Manages book inventory (adding books, searching for books).
    - Provides methods to query books by title, author, genre, etc.
- **RentalService**:
    - Handles book rentals and returns.
    - Tracks which member has rented a specific book.

#### **2.3. Domain Layer**

- **Book (Abstract Class)**:
    
    - Represents a general book with properties like title, author, genre, and availability.
    - Abstract methods for behavior specific to subclasses.
- **PhysicalBook (Concrete Class)**:
    
    - Inherits from `Book`.
    - Can be reserved and rented physically.
- **EBook (Concrete Class)**:
    
    - Inherits from `Book`.
    - Can be downloaded but does not need physical availability.
- **Member**:
    
    - Represents a library member with attributes like name and ID.
    - Tracks the books rented by the member.
- **Rental**:
    
    - Represents a rental transaction.
    - Tracks the `Member`, `Book`, rental date, and return date.

#### **2.4. Persistence Layer**

- **BookRepository**:
    
    - Stores and retrieves books.
    - Can use an in-memory `Map<String, Book>` (keyed by book ID).
- **MemberRepository**:
    
    - Stores and retrieves members.
- **RentalRepository**:
    
    - Tracks active rentals and rental history.
