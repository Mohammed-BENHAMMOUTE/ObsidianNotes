## Spring IoC (Inversion of Control)

Spring IoC is a core principle of the Spring framework that manages object creation and lifecycle. It inverts the control of object creation from the application to the framework.

### Advantages of Spring IoC:
- Reduced coupling between classes
- Increased modularity and testability
- Easier configuration management
- Simplified application development

## Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

AOP is a programming paradigm that allows separation of cross-cutting concerns:
- Separates business logic from technical code
- Examples: logging, security, transactions

## Dependency Injection (DI)

DI is a `design pattern` used to implement `IoC`. It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to a class.

### Types of Dependency Injection:

1. **Constructor Injection**
   ```java
   public class ServiceImpl {
       private final Repository repository;
       
       public ServiceImpl(Repository repository) {
           this.repository = repository;
       }
   }
```
2. **Setter Injection**
```java
public class ServiceImpl {
    private Repository repository;
    
    public void setRepository(Repository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
}
```
3. ***Field Injection (using `@Autowired`)*** 
```java
public class ServiceImpl {
    @Autowired
    private Repository repository;
}
```

## Loose Coupling

Loose coupling can be achieved through dynamic instantiation:
```java 
Class<?> cDao = Class.forName(daoClassName);
IDao dao = (IDao) cDao.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();

Class<?> cMetier = Class.forName(metierClassName);
IMetier metier = (IMetier) cMetier.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();

Method setDaoMethod = cMetier.getMethod("setDao", IDao.class);
setDaoMethod.invoke(metier, dao);
```

## Working with Spring

### Dependency Management

- Use Maven or Gradle
- Maven uses `pom.xml` (Project Object Model)
- Libraries stored in local repository (`~/.m2`)
- Remote repositories used if not found locally
### Maven Commands

- `mvn compile`: Compile source code
- `mvn test`: Run tests (e.g., JUnit)
- `mvn package`: Create JAR/WAR file
- `mvn install`: Install package to local repository
- `mvn deploy`: Deploy to remote repository
- `mvn site`: Generate project site documentation

## Spring Dependency Injection

### XML Configuration
```xml
<!-- applicationContext.xml -->
<beans>
    <bean id="dao" class="com.example.DaoImpl"/>
    <bean id="service" class="com.example.ServiceImpl">
        <property name="dao" ref="dao"/>
    </bean>
</beans>
```


```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
IService service = context.getBean("service", IService.class);
```
### Annotation-based Configuration

Use `@Component` on classes to be instantiated and `@Autowired` for automatic dependency injection.

```java
@Component
public class ServiceImpl implements IService {
    private final IDao dao;
    
    @Autowired
    public ServiceImpl(IDao dao) {
        this.dao = dao;
    }
}
```

```java
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext("com.example");
IService service = context.getBean(IService.class);
```


In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container.



### Best Practices

- Prefer constructor injection over field injection
- Use interfaces for better abstraction and testability
- Utilize component scanning for automatic bean discovery

## Additional Notes

- Spring manages the lifecycle of beans (creation, initialization, destruction)
- Consider using Spring Boot for simplified configuration and setup
- Explore Spring profiles for environment-specific configurations.
