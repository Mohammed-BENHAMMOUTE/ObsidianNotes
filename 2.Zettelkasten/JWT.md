[[authentication]]

**JWT Basics**:
- JWT is a compact, self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object
- Commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web development

**Structure**:
1. Header: Contains token type and hashing algorithm
2. Payload: Contains claims (statements about the user and additional data)
3. Signature: Ensures token hasn't been altered

**Key Characteristics**:
- Stateless: Server doesn't need to store session information
- Portable: Can be used across different domains
- Secure: Digitally signed

Use Cases:
- Authentication
- Information Exchange
- Authorization

Advantages:
- Scalability
- Mobile-friendly
- Cross-domain/Cross-origin

Disadvantages:
- Can't be revoked before expiration
- Payload size limitations

Best Practices:
- Use HTTPS
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Don't store sensitive information in payload
- Use strong secret keys

Implementation:
- Many libraries available for various programming languages
- Typically used with Bearer authentication scheme

Security Considerations:
- Protect against XSS and CSRF attacks
- Be cautious of JWT cracking attempts
