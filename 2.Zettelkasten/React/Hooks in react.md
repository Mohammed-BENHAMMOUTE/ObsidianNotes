# UseMemo
what is useMemo?
useMemo is a hook used for performance optimisation, so when we have a value and computing that value takes a lot of time , we dont want to run that code that renders it at each render, but only when the state related to that variable changes, so then we use USEMEMO hook.
the second use case is the referentiel equality, whenever you want to make sure the reference of an object or an array is exactly the same as the previous time. 
for example react dark theme.
