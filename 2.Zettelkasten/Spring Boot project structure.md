## Package Descriptions and Interactions

1. **config/**
   - Purpose: Contains configuration classes
   - Examples: Security config, database config, custom beans
   - Interactions: Used across all layers as needed

2. **controller/**
   - Purpose: Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Responsibilities: 
     - Define API endpoints
     - Validate input
     - Call appropriate service methods
     - Handle responses and errors
   - Interactions: 
     - Depends on service layer
     - Should not contain business logic
     - Should not directly interact with repositories

3. **model/**
   - Purpose: Defines data structures and domain objects
   - Contents: 
     - Entity classes (mapped to database tables)
     - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
     - Value Objects
   - Interactions: 
     - Used across all layers
     - Contains minimal logic, mostly getters/setters and basic validation

4. **repository/**
   - Purpose: Handles data access and storage
   - Responsibilities:
     - Define database operations
     - Implement custom queries
   - Interactions:
     - Used by service layer
     - Should not be directly accessed by controllers
     - Typically extends Spring Data interfaces

5. **service/**
   - Purpose: Contains business logic
   - Responsibilities:
     - Implement business rules and workflows
     - Coordinate use of multiple repositories
     - Handle transactions
   - Interactions:
     - Called by controllers
     - Uses repositories for data access
     - May use other services

6. **util/**
   - Purpose: Contains utility classes and helper methods
   - Examples: Custom exceptions, constants, common helper methods
   - Interactions: Can be used across all layers as needed

## Key Principles

1. **Dependency Injection**: Use Spring's IoC container for managing dependencies between layers.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer should have a distinct responsibility.

3. **Loose Coupling**: Higher layers should depend on interfaces of lower layers, not concrete implementations.

4. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Extract common logic into reusable components.

5. **SOLID Principles**: Follow SOLID principles for better design and maintainability.

## Flow of Control

1. HTTP Request → Controller
2. Controller → Service
3. Service → Repository (if data access is needed)
4. Repository → Database
5. Results flow back up the chain

## Additional Considerations

- Use DTOs to transfer data between layers, especially at the API boundary.
- Implement proper exception handling and logging throughout the application.
- Consider using aspect-oriented programming (AOP) for cross-cutting concerns like logging or security.
- Utilize Spring Boot's auto-configuration but override when necessary in the config package.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain as it grows.
