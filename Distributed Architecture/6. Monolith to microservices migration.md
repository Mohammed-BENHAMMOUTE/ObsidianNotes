most of the time we dont start with a microservices application, rather we start with a monolith and we refactor to Microservices.

ilities decline overtime when the complexity of our application becomes more complexe.

Each service is:
+ Highly maintainable and testable.
+ Loosely coupled.
+ Independently deployable.
+ Organized around business capabilities
+ Owned by a small team

**Conways Law**: 
the software architecture mimics the architecture of the working environment.

when should we migrate from a monolith to a **Microservices** application?




how to measure success in microservices application?

+ Reduced lead time.
+ Increased deployment frequency. 
+ reduced changed failure rate.
