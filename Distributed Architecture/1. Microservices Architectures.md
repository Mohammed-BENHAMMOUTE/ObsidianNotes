what are they? 
single purpose functions deployed as separate units with each owning its own data.

each service owns its table, meaning only it can read or write from its table.

microservices: single-purpose, separately deployed unit of software that does ones thing. 

bounded context (share nothing architecure), its mostly there to facilitate change. decoupling.

when to use microservices:

agility, deployability, elasticity, evolvability, fault-tolerance, scalability


1. Agility
2. very fast mean time to start/recover
3. high vault tolerance needs.
4. cloud base deployments

when not to use cases:
1. cost:
   large monolothic data that we cant break apart. especially relational data.
2. Simplicity:
3. performance:
	highly coupled functionality.

3-types of latency:
1. network latency.
2. Security latency.
3. data latency.
